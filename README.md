# Qubeon³

**Qubeon³** is a cube-native data engine designed to replace flat, tuple-based relational systems with true multidimensional structures. Built for a dimensional world, Qubeon³ embraces the cube as the fundamental unit of data organization — enabling more intuitive queries, better performance for structured analytics, and alignment with modern AI and simulation workflows.

> “SQL was for tables. Qubeon³ is for dimensions.”

## 📖 Why Qubeon³?

Relational databases **flattened** the world into rows.
NoSQL systems **scattered** it into blobs.
Neither honored the **true shape** of real-world data.

Qubeon³ is a cube-native engine — built from the ground up to store, query, and reason with **structured, multidimensional information**.

We believe some data doesn’t belong in tables.
It belongs in **cubes**.

## 🔧 Features (Planned)

- Native 3D (and nD) data modeling
- CubeQL: expressive query language for multidimensional datasets
- Slice, align, contract, and transpose across axes
- Columnar storage with memory-mapped cubes
- Python and CLI interfaces (early prototypes)
