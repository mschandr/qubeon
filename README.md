# Qubeon³

**Qubeon³** is a cube-native data engine designed to replace flat, tuple-based relational systems with true multidimensional structures. Built for a dimensional world, Qubeon³ embraces the cube as the fundamental unit of data organization — enabling more intuitive queries, better performance for structured analytics, and alignment with modern AI and simulation workflows.

> “SQL was for tables. Qubeon³ is for dimensions.”
