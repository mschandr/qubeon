"Reorder the axes three times, return to the start — such is the symmetry of space."

🧮 Proposition
For any cube or cuboid 𝒬 of dimension (X, Y, Z), a triple transposition of axes using a cyclic permutation restores the original layout.

Formally:


```math
Transpose(Transpose(Transpose(𝒬, (1,2,0)), (1,2,0)), (1,2,0)) = 𝒬
```
This holds for regular (e.g. 3×3×3) and irregular (e.g. 4×3×2) cubes.


## 🧠 Why It Holds
Transposition is an axis permutation. The group of axis permutations under composition forms a finite group.

A 3D transposition by (1,2,0) is a cyclic permutation of order 3. So:

```math
π = (0 → 1 → 2 → 0)
π³ = identity permutation
```

Therefore:

$`Transpose³ = Identity`$

## 🧪 Code Verification

```python
import numpy as np

def triple_transpose_identity(arr):
    t1 = np.transpose(arr, (1, 2, 0))
    t2 = np.transpose(t1, (1, 2, 0))
    t3 = np.transpose(t2, (1, 2, 0))
    return np.array_equal(arr, t3)
```

## ✅ Tests
```python
print("3x3x3:", triple_transpose_identity(np.random.rand(3, 3, 3)))
print("4x3x2:", triple_transpose_identity(np.random.rand(4, 3, 2)))
print("50x100x1:", triple_transpose_identity(np.random.rand(50, 100, 1)))
print("1x1x1:", triple_transpose_identity(np.random.rand(1, 1, 1)))
```

## 🧾 Propositional Form
Let `π` be a cyclic permutation of axes (0,1,2):

$`T(𝒬, π)`$ applies the permutation

$`T³(𝒬, π) = 𝒬`$

We define the transpositional identity as:

$`∀𝒬 ∈ ℝ³, T³(𝒬) ≡ 𝒬`$

Which reads:

For all 3D arrays ($`𝒬`$), transposing it three times by the same cyclic permutation returns the original.

## 📍 Implications
- Transposition is deterministic and lossless
- Axis permutations form a closed, finite group
- Enables formal transform symmetry checks across all operators
